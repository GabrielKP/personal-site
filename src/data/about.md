# Intro

I am a Computer Science student that is deeply passionate about discovering and
implementing the algorithms behind perception, cognition and behaviour. Being
on the verge of deciding the immediate path my life will take, I am full of energy
learning about new topics and absorbing all advice, experiences and lessons I can.
Full of ideas, ambitious plans and a probably hopelessly overly idealistic worldview I
am trying to reach for the stars. Let's see what the future holds.

# Vision

I am dedicated to become a researcher in the intersection of Computer Science and
Cognitive Science to understand the workings of the human mind, the usage of that
knowledge in Computer Science and resulting from that, to create technologies
improving our living conditions.
I am certain that, by being part of working on the probably most powerful and life
changing concept the future holds - buzz word alert - Artificial Intelligence (AI), I
am going to have a positive influence on society’s living conditions. This already
can be observed with today’s AI influencing fields like medical treatment, transport,
and also enabling us to do Natural Language Processing and speech recognition.
That being said, I think it is extremely important to implement suitable mechanisms
to prevent abuse, discrimination and an increasing social inequality.

# Currently

I am finishing by Bachelor Degree in Computer Science at Freie Universität Berlin.
At the same time I have started working withing the German Institute for Artificial
Intelligence [(DFKI)](https://www.dfki.de/en/web/) as student assistant in the
[Speech and Language Technologies](https://www.dfki.de/en/web/research/research-departments/speech-and-language-technology) group.

# Interests

My biggest interest currently revolve around:
- Natural Language Processing
- [Subsymbolic connectionist models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach) such as [Tensor Product Representations](https://doi.org/10.1016/0004-3702(90)90007-M),
- Representations in the Mind and Artificial Neural Networks
- [Continual/Incremental Learning](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neunet.2019.01.012)
- human and artificial Visual Perception
- [mechanistic models of the human brain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01490)
- the efficient implementation of the correct abstractions to the describe the mind and brain, such as feedback connections, dendritic computations, biologically inspired
learning rules or spiking neural networks
- [algorithmic brain development](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691181226/the-self-assembling-brain).

# Fun facts

- People tell me I look shorter on Zoom than in Real Life.
- Yes, I started growing my hair before Corona.
- No, I still have not found the right hair routine.
- I was (second degree) uncle before I was born.
- Because I grew up bilingually, I sometimes confuse numbers in the range of
60-99: in German you say the last position first, in Spanish it is the other way
around (It is interesting that I only noticed the phenomenon for numbers >60).
- I seem to be bad in _deciphering_ what people say, even though my
hearing itself is good (according to doctors...).
- I never changed my piano teacher (she is great).
- [The best Hot Chocolate place in Berlin](https://www.berliner-kaffeeroesterei.de/).
- Yes, I like the US
- Put on 80/90/00s music and I _dance, dance, dance_.
- My metabolism does not abide by the laws of the universe, if I eat a piece of
cake I gain double of it's weight the next day.
- Luckily I lose weight as fast as I gain it.
- Yes, my phenotype is the analog of mixing coffee with milk.
- I am bad with names AND faces, but I am not prosopagnosic.
