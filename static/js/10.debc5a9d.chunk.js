Being\non the verge of deciding the immediate path my life will take, I am full of energy\nlearning about new topics and absorbing all advice, experiences and lessons I can.\nFull of ideas, ambitious plans and a probably hopelessly overly idealistic worldview I\nam trying to reach for the stars. Let's see what the future holds.\n\n# Vision\n\nI am dedicated to become a researcher in the intersection of Computer Science and\nCognitive Science to understand the workings of the human mind, the usage of that\nknowledge in Computer Science and resulting from that, to create technologies\nimproving our living conditions.\nI am certain that, by being part of working on the probably most powerful and life\nchanging concept the future holds - buzz word alert - Artificial Intelligence (AI), I\nam going to have a positive influence on society\u2019s living conditions. This already\ncan be observed with today\u2019s AI influencing fields like medical treatment, transport,\nand also enabling us to do Natural Language Processing and speech recognition.\nThat being said, I think it is extremely important to implement suitable mechanisms\nto prevent abuse, discrimination and an increasing social inequality.\n\n# Currently\n\nI am finishing by Bachelor Degree in Computer Science at Freie Universit\xe4t Berlin.\nAt the same time I have started working withing the German Institute for Artificial\nIntelligence [(DFKI)](https://www.dfki.de/en/web/) as student assistant in the\n[Speech and Language Technologies](https://www.dfki.de/en/web/research/research-departments/speech-and-language-technology) group.\n\n# Interests\n\nMy biggest interest currently revolve around:\n- Natural Language Processing\n- [Subsymbolic connectionist models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach) such as [Tensor Product Representations](https://doi.org/10.1016/0004-3702(90)90007-M),\n- Representations in the Mind and Artificial Neural Networks\n- [Continual/Incremental Learning](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neunet.2019.01.012)\n- human and artificial Visual Perception\n- [mechanistic models of the human brain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01490)\n- the efficient implementation of the correct abstractions to the describe the mind and brain, such as feedback connections, dendritic computations, biologically inspired\nlearning rules or spiking neural networks\n- [algorithmic brain development](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691181226/the-self-assembling-brain).\n\n# Fun facts\n\n- People tell me I look shorter on Zoom than in Real Life.\n- Yes, I started growing my hair before Corona.\n- No, I still have not found the right hair routine.\n- I was (second degree) uncle before I was born.\n- Because I grew up bilingually, I sometimes confuse numbers in the range of\n60-99: in German you say the last position first, in Spanish it is the other way\naround (It is interesting that I only noticed the phenomenon for numbers >60).\n- I seem to be bad in _deciphering_ what people say, even though my\nhearing itself is good (according to doctors...).\n- I never changed my piano teacher (she is great).\n- [The best Hot Chocolate place in Berlin](https://www.berliner-kaffeeroesterei.de/).\n- Yes, I like the US\n- Put on 80/90/00s music and I _dance, dance, dance_.\n- My metabolism does not abide by the laws of the universe, if I eat a piece of\ncake I gain double of it's weight the next day.\n- Luckily I lose weight as fast as I gain it.\n- Yes, my phenotype is the analog of mixing coffee with milk.\n- I am bad with names AND faces, but I am not prosopagnosic.\n",h=l.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,d=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return Object(i.jsx)(s.b,Object(a.a)({},n))};n.default=function(){return Object(i.jsx)(c.a,{description:"Gabriel Kressin&apos;s personal website.",children:Object(i.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[Object(i.jsx)("header",{children:Object(i.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[Object(i.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:Object(i.jsx)(s.b,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),Object(i.jsxs)("p",{children:["Welcome to my website.
